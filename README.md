### Teacher`s Side In Details

***Need to Konw: It is recommended to use the [react.semantic-ui](https://react.semantic-ui.com) for building all pages` UI***

In Teacher`s Workshop Page(Home Page), We need to use the following interface:

* /getactiveclass
* /getworktype
* /searchallwork
* /markwork

In Teacher`s Management Page, We need to use the following interface:

* /addyear
* /delyear
* /getyearinfo
* /addclass
* /delclass
* /setclasstype
* /getclassbyyear
* /addstudent
* /delstudent
* /getstubyclass

In Teacher`s Statistics Page, We need to use the following interface:

* /getworkcount
* /getclasscount
